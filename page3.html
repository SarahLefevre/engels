</div><div>
</div><div>In this text I will delve into the subject matter connected with a personal letter that I wrote to Jane Austen, author of ' Pride &amp; Prejudice ', in which I was looking for a link between her book and my paintings. In this letter I deepened in the psychology of the individual and how she does this as well. So I say that I  paint my friends and family in their natural environment and how this is a place that I myself know well. Because in this way it’s also a portrait of myself and what I know. I wrote about what makes these people unique for me. In this text I would like to go even further. How is an individual represented and how do I picture this visually so that the spectator thinks and feels what I want them to feel?
</div><div>
</div><div>As I have previously mentioned in my letter, I often think about how people are experienced. This is a very subtle, nuanced subject. In 1986, Curt Hoffman wrote about this social psychology. He described a theory that says  a culture determines how we experience people. This is called the implicit personality theory. This theory shows that multiple personality traits 'always' occur together and that they are fully determined by the culture in which we grew up. An experiment was conducted in which various subjects were given a story about a particular individual who is going through different things. This person had clear traits in these situations. Afterwards they asked these people what kind of person this individual was. The ones with the same cultural background gave similar personality characteristics to this person while this did not appear in the text. This means that we unconsciously link different properties to each other. For example, when a person looks nice, we're going to assume that this person is also 'good'. So, we unconsciously make an extensive schedule of how people are put together and how they behave.
</div><div>
</div><div>Jane Austen also influenced her readers in this way. I will automatically link characteristics and properties to the person in question without it being explicitly mentioned in the text. As I said in my letter, my opinion of the characters changed gradually. In the beginning of the book, I thought an individual unpleasant, but as the main character started to know more about this person, I did too. Hoffman also discussed this in addition to his theory. He said that when one constructs a fixed schedule about how a person is, influenced by the cultural standard, he begins to expect certain things from this individual. When this person in question does something that is unexpected, one will ignore or supplement this in the schedule. This is how we categorize an individual.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>In this way Austen was a master at her craft. She deliberately chose to complete or leave things out of her book. So as a reader, we are following a path and with no other way out. If she wants an individual in her story to be experienced as insufferable, they will be. That's the power of art. That is also what I want to achieve with my work. I want to consciously think about what images and words can influence someone subconsciously. So, I'm looking for a way were language in particular has this influence.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>
</div><div>If we look at the conceptual art of the sixties, we see a lot of artists who were working with this subject. Joseph Kosuth was a precursor with his work '3 chairs'. This work was a setup in which there were three different representations of the same chair. Namely, a picture of the Chair, the physical Chair and a definition of the word 'chair'. Because of this work a lot of people in the art world were dealing with the question: "which of the three representations is the most accurate?" In this way a dialogue about the meaning of the work took place. Kosuth also said so himself: "Art is making meaning.". Also David Lynch gave a different meaning to a simple object based on words in his work ' Ricky Boards '. In this work he took a Board on which he pinned a number of bees. These were relatively the same. Below he placed a different name. This gave each bee a special meaning and self feature for the spectators, because they had a certain link with those specific names.
</div><div>
</div><div>Another master of this matter was Magritte. His most famous work 'La trahison des images' is one of the biggest examples. He also gave specific titles to his paintings to give them extra power. For example 'the obvious meeting'. This is a painting in which two foreign figures stand against a wall with two windows. Their faces are not human and not readable. Because of a playful title associated with the work, the work immediately becomes lighter and less dissuasive. Though I find that playing with titles is a lot more terrifying than a integrating a word or sentence explicitly in the painting. A title, I believe, has a different kind of feeling, it is a fixture. While painted text can still flow in the image and influence it in a different way.
</div><div>
</div><div>So, I'm looking for a way to create a link with a particular word or phrase in order to give my image a more specific meaning. Right now, I'm working on a painting about my grandmother. I started with a snapshot moment that I photographed a visit. This is a portrait of her at her dining table in her typical Flemish decorated interior. To give the spectator the image that I want, I painted the interior in a certain atmosphere with partial natural and artificial light. I will paint my grandmother in a gentle way, so that the viewer can feel my loving bond with her. But I would like to give an extra force to the work. To do this, I would write down a sentence. This sentence will probably be: “ A Vlaemisch portrait “. Because the word 'Flemish' written in this older way, I could give the work a playful atmosphere. Because this particular word is often used in a humorous way to obsolete Flemish habits.
</div><div>
</div><div>My teachers have already proven that language can make a difference. They gave their opinion about my work without the text first. They had a criticism on the brown color of the room and how this would darken the work. When I told them that I painted it like this because it is a 'typical West-Flemish Interior', they began to smile. Suddenly they didn’t find this a problem anymore.
</div><div>
</div><div>I plan on painting portraits of my loved ones and integrate key words on these paintings. These words would reflect how I experience them. These words indirectly show what I consider important. For example, when I paint my brother the word 'narcissistic' comes up, this is because this strikes me. So, the spectator will also experience him in this way and create this opinion about him. In this way, I can decide how many words I choose, so the scheme about him can be changed. For me, there is a certain freedom while the spectator is forced in a more specific direction. In this way, I will always be on top of my own work.
